The file make_fig_mainQQ.R will create Figure 6 for you, using existing results that are stored in the "res" folder.

To reproduce the results from the "res" folder, you need to run the file run_QQ_smallDim.R a total of XXXXX times, each with a different set of parameters. This is accomplished using the call_QQ.sh and submit_QQ.sh files. 

You will also need access to simulation_functions.R, which is stored in the main directory.
