The file make_fig_MSE.R will create Figure 3 for you, using existing results that are stored in the "res" folder.

To reproduce the results from the "res" folder, you need to run the file run_mse.R a total of 2000 times (only 500 replications are stored in the "res" folder, for repository size reasons).

run_mse.R requires that you source simulation_functions.R, which is stored in the main directory.
